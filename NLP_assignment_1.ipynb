       "\"The Academy Awards , commonly known as The Oscars , is an annual American awards ceremony honoring achievements in the film industry . Winners are awarded the statuette , officially the Academy Award of Merit , that is much better known by its nickname Oscar . The awards , first presented in 1929 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel , are overseen by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) .\\nThe awards ceremony was first televised in 1953 and is now seen live in more than 200 countries . The Oscars is also the oldest entertainment awards ceremony ; its equivalents , the Emmy Awards for television , the Tony Awards for theatre , and the Grammy Awards for music and recording , are modeled after the Academy Awards .\\nThe 86th Academy Awards were held on March 2 , 2014 , at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles .\\nThe first Academy Awards were presented on May 16 , 1929 , at a private dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with an audience of about 270 people . The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel . The cost of guest tickets for that night 's ceremony was $5. Fifteen statuettes were awarded , honoring artists , directors and other personalities of the film-making industry of the time for their works during the 1927â€“28 period ; the ceremony ran for 15 minutes .\\nWinners had been announced to media three months earlier ; however , that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930 . Since then and during the first decade , the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began ; as a result , the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners .\\nThe first Best Actor awarded was Emil Jannings , for his performances in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh . He had to return to Europe before the ceremony , so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier ; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history . The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period ; for example , Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and Janet Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films . Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed , and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film . For the first six ceremonies , the eligibility period spanned two calendar years .\\nMany movie historians believe that High Noon lost out for the 1952 Best Picture Award to The Greatest Show on Earth because the initial release of High Noon bared a panoramic view of modern downtown Los Angeles .\\nAt the 29th ceremony , held on March 27 , 1957 , the Best Foreign Language Film category was introduced . Until then , foreign-language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award .\\nAs of the 83rd Academy Awards ceremony held in 2011, a total of 2,894 Oscars have been given for 1,853 awards.\\n\""

    "Tatoeba is a large database of sentences and translations often used by people looking to learn a new language. Hence, the dataset I had downloaded contained a list of basic english sentences.\n",
    "This folder initially downlaoded as a '.bz2' file but I was able to convet it to a '.zip' file using https://cloudconvert.com/bz2-to-zip, and then extract the file from this zip file.\n",
    "This dataset offered me access to a dataset of over 1.4 million sentences and nearly 80,000 words, however due to the basic nature of these sentences I didn't find the generations very interesting. Despite this, it did prove a useful first step in getting the generation process up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, I wanted to choose a dataset that was more interesting in terms of the generation. This is where I found a dataset of both real and fake news. I was able to download this from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset. Theis download contained two files, with each containing a table of information on either fake or real news articles. This table contained an article title, the article itself, the date the article was posted and the topic of the artic.\n",
    "In my case, I was only interested in the title column, which contained over 23,000 article titles in the fake news CSV. This was perfect for my use case as it gave 23,000 easily accessible fake news sentences that I could use to train my generation model and generate more fake news article titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the README.md only addresses this fake news dataset, I also generate sentences using the original basic english sentence dataset and the real news dataset. These can be found at the bottom of this notebook as extra to this assignment. They demonstrate the generation ability of this code across multiple datasets."
